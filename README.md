# API Hack Project

* Research RESTful APIs and design client-side applications

## Requirements

* The application must make use of a third-party API and use the results to
  change the DOM.
* Plan app in detail beforehand.
* Responsive media queries.

## App Brainstorming

### Google Maps API

* Google Maps API that calculates what's halfway around the world from the user
  with the song by ATeens playing in the background.
* The antinode of most of North America is somewhere in teh Indian Ocean so the
  app would need to point to the closest city maybe.

### Weather API

* Weather API that detects the weather where you're at and tries to find other
  cities with the same weather.
* Maybe use multiple apis and check to see how far apart their results are.
